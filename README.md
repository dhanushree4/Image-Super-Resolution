# Image-Super-Resolution
This project demonstrates how to enhance the resolution and sharpness of low-quality images using a pre-trained **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) model via **TensorFlow Hub**. It's particularly useful in scenarios such as **video conferencing**, where image clarity is often compromised due to low bandwidth or poor internet conditions.

- Loads and processes low-resolution images using OpenCV
- Converts color space for correct visualization
- Applies the ESRGAN model for 4Ã— super-resolution
- Displays high-resolution results with `matplotlib`
- Real-time, plug-and-play enhancement pipeline
